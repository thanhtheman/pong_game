"2x Speed"
After playing for a while, a circle will appear in the middle of the screen. If the player can direct the ball to hit this feature. 
The ball's velocity will increase to 2x which makes it more difficult for the other player to handle.

Let's break it down this feature:

1. "After a while" = when it will appear: we need a "thing" to keep track of time
It can be a counter. What is the anchor? Like when the game starts or when a specific number of collisions happen (the ball is hit back and forth)
Let's go with the # of collisions (both top & bottom sides)
With the counter we can set it will disappear after a specific number of collisions

<--- Coding --->
We need:
 1/ a counter variable to keep track the number of collisions
 2/ a function to show the "2x Speed" circle once the counter reaches a specific number - let's set it to 10 for now.

How can we count the number of collisions?
Maybe by counting the number of the function handle_collision() is called?
Nope, we can just simply increase collision_counter by 1 whenever it meets the condtion of a collision (paddle and top & bottom sides)
Let's test to see if this counter is working by printing it on the console

2. "A circle will appear in the middle of the screen"
We can draw the circle and position it somewhere in the middle of the screen

3. "If the player can direct the ball to hit this feature, the ball's velocity will increase to 2x"
We can set up the collision condition so that the speed 2x will be in effect.
